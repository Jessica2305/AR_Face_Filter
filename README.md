# AR_Face_Filter
Assignment on creating AR face filters using Unity.

## Process

During the start of the learning phase, I began with Unity Essentials pathway, through which i learned the basics of Unity and created 5 scenes involving both 2D and 3D basics. Finally I created my own implementation, ie, a game that included most of the knowledge from the tutorial. 

### Task 
The task given to us required following the Mobile AR development pathway. After completing the first part of the basic face tutorial and creating the face filter, I decided to create a Christmas themed filter. Using the knowledge from the tutorial and importing various new assets from Unity Store while creating changes to them to incorporate the Christmas theme, I created a face filter that includes `accessories` (Santa hat), `animation` (mustache), `VFX effects` (snow) and `3D objects` (star, present, candycane and snowflake) that follow the user's face. 

The more I've worked with Unity, my curiosity grew and I have now started the second part of the tutorial, ie, the interactive glasses filter.

Overall, I've had a great experience working with the software. I'm grateful I was given this opportunity to learn more about game and AR development. I know there's a long way to go but I'm definitely interested in putting my full effort in learning and I hope I'm given the opportunity to work on the project and bring my new found knowledge to good use.
